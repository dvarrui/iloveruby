README (in the top-level directory, which should be the one you're in now)
contains all the documentation for this package, apart from the RDoc
information.

You can read it as plain text if you like, but it's easier to read as HTML
after being RDoc'ed.  Two options:
 * run 'ruby install-doc.rb' (probably Unix/Cygwin only for now)
    and/or
 * read the README as HTML online at http://extensions.rubyforge.org.

The HTML on the internet contains RDocs for the very latest (CVS) code.
