This file describes the difference between releases, and documents that date
those releases were made.  See ChangeLog for more information.

2003-10-04, v0.2.0 (v0_2_0)

  - string.rb completed with working functionality, two more methods, and full
    unit tests.  New methods:
       String#taballto
       String#leftmost_indent
       String#expand_tabs

  - Numeric#format_s, adopted from Austin Ziegler's contribution to
    FixNumFormat on the wiki, added.

  - Fixed important typo in install-doc.rb.

  - Removed most methods from io.rb as they look cluttered and I'm not exactly
    sure what to do with them!  Only IO.write remains, which is the only
    really important one.

  - Generated RDoc goes to directory "rdoc" not "doc" now.  It is installed to
    that directory, and uploaded to http://extensions.rubyforge.org/rdoc with
    etc/doctools/website/upload.sh.

  - General improvement in documentation.

  - etc/release directory introduced for generating tarballs from CVS.


2003-10-02, v0.1 (v0_1)

  - 'rbxtm' returns the following

       Class#autoinit
       Enumerable#build_hash
       Enumerable#collect_with_index
       Enumerable#contains?
       Enumerable#has?
       Enumerable#includes?
       Enumerable#map_with_index
       IO::read_binary
       IO::read_text
       IO::write
       IO::write_binary
       IO::write_text
       Integer#even?
       Integer#odd?
       Object#in?
       Object#singleton_class
       String#indent
       String#outdent
       String#tabto
       String#trim

  - Not all methods are thoroughly tested.  String and IO are the only ones
    lacking, I think.

  - Infrastructure: etc/website/*, etc/doctools/*, README all in good shape.
    etc/release/* nonexistent.
