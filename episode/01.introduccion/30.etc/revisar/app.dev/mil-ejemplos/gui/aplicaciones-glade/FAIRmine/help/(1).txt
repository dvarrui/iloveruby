     Mines is a puzzle game where you
     locate mines floating in an ocean using only your brain and a
     little bit of luck.
    


      You start the game with a grid of covered squares and no idea what is in them. Clicking on a square reveals
      what is in it: either empty ocean or a mine. If you
      find a mine bad things happen and the game is over. If you
      uncover an empty square, you survive and get to try again. We do
      give you a bit of help; if you find an empty piece of ocean
      a number is printed there telling you how many mines are in the 
      adjacent squares (or no number if there are no nearby
      mines). Once you find a few clear squares you can start to
      deduce which squares have mines in them and which don't. You win
      the game once you have revealed all the un-mined squares and
      marked all the mined squares.
    


		(the stages of game: start, playing, waiting, losing, winning)
  
      
      To mark a square as having a mine you right-click on it and a
      flag is placed there. If you click on a square with a number and
      you have placed precisely that number of flags on adjacent
      squares then the remaining squares are revealed. If you didn't
      mark the mines correctly then an explosion will occur and the game
      is over. Squares with no adjacent mines (i.e. blank squares)
      have their adjacent squares automatically cleared.



      You are being timed. To be good at this game you have to work
      both quickly and correctly. Once you have found all the mines
      and revealed all the un-mined squares the clock is stopped. Your
      score is the time you took; the shorter the better.
